# textadventure-ravenswood-color

Here you find a beautiful but still unfinished version of our Python textadventure.

This is another version of a simple pure python textadventure. It is not self contained anymore, because it uses random and colorama. But the cmplete game mechanics a fully visible and therefore understandable in reasonable short (or long, depending on your position) time.
