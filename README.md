# textadventure-ravenswood-color

Here you find a beautiful but still unfinished version of our Python textadventure.

This is another version of a simple pure python textadventure. It is not self contained anymore, because it uses `random` and `colorama`. But the complete game mechanics are fully visible and therefore understandable in reasonable short time.
